This plugin will automatically links to terms in your content to that term's page.

== Description ==

This plugin will automatically links to terms in your content to that term's page. Can be used for tags, categories and custom taxonomies. Based on Chen Ju's Automatic Tag Links.

The plugin will only match full words, so if you have a term called "World" and use the word "worldwide" it will link not link world. Furthermore, if you have the term Worldwide Imports it will link the longer term first.

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin.
3. Upload it to your plugins folder.
4. Activate if from the plugins page.
5. Select the taxonomies to link. 

== Upcoming features ==
* A better way to store terms in order to ensure better performance and more consistent linking.
* Auto-select tags and categories as the default links, so the site doesn't break.
* Only link terms with more than x posts.
